[{"content":"At Biologize, we have three goals:  Make modern science accessible to the public Provide topical resources for students in biology Highlight some of the most fascinating and inspirational scientists  Make modern science accessible to the public Every year, billions of dollars are poured into scientific research in the U.S. and across the world. The majority of this money comes from everyday people, not unlike yourself, in the form of taxes and charitable donations (although there is the odd billionaire who pours substantial amounts of their own money into science -Thanks DVA!). But most people have no idea what happens after that. How does money become science and how does science return any tangible investment? We hear about \u0026lsquo;investing in science\u0026rsquo; like it is another publicly traded business but there aren\u0026rsquo;t dependable yearly dividends when it comes to actually doing science (trust me on that). However, biological science does have value. Substantial value at that. We want to communicate the impact of this work. At Biologize, we translate that science into something understandable to the non-scientist.\nProvide topical resources for students in biology When starting to learn science, two main themes come to the forefront of any student: 1) rote memorization, and 2) the scientific method. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe in rote memorization. Repeating things over and over does not help anyone learn something. We might remember it for a bit, just long enough to get through that next test, but in the long term, it\u0026rsquo;s not ideal. I have the memory of a hamster, so this method of learning is a non-starter on my end. Also, google makes memorization obsolete (there, I said it). Learning is about interacting with material, having provoking conversations, making connections, and coming up with new ideas. That is what we want to emphasize with this blog. As far as the scientific method goes, critical thinking is key. Research is an intricate art. We have to know every detail of an experiment, gently optimize the protocol, and carefully assess the resulting data. We will provide simple explanations of some of the most common techniques used in modern biology. Happy little mistakes happen (sometimes not so happy). We will give our own tips for success and common mistakes to avoid. Techniques are malleable and change based on the needs of the experiment.\nHighlight some of the most fascinating and inspirational scientists Science happens in the context of everyday society. Be that Marie Curie\u0026rsquo;s 19th and 20th century France or Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Ancient Greece. There is no perfect society and there sure as hell ain\u0026rsquo;t no perfect scientist (or writer, I might add). Human history is riddled with mistakes, discrimination, and hidden figures who are never recognized. This is true for science. We hope to showcase some of the under-appreciated scientists who have made discoveries that shape our past, present, and future. There\u0026rsquo;s drama and despair; trials and tribulations. Scientists are everyday people just trying to survive in the world. Their stories are insightful, intriguing, and just plain fascinating.\nWe hope you tag along and learn a thing or two about the wonders of science and the people who make it happen. These are exciting times in biological science. Groundbreaking discoveries are happening all around us at a record pace, we just have to take a peak.\nNerd up and get excited about biology, folks, because it\u0026rsquo;s time to Biologize!\n","permalink":"https://biologize.github.io/hugotest/about/","summary":"At Biologize, we have three goals:  Make modern science accessible to the public Provide topical resources for students in biology Highlight some of the most fascinating and inspirational scientists  Make modern science accessible to the public Every year, billions of dollars are poured into scientific research in the U.S. and across the world.
